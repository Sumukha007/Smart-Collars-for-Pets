The "Smart Collars for Pets" project involves developing a web application to track pets' locations in real-time using smart collars, displaying their movements on an interactive map with boundary alerts and location history. Users can input pet details, including a unique collar ID, and monitor their safety within a defined area. The system also provides continuous location updates and warnings if the pet leaves the designated boundary.
