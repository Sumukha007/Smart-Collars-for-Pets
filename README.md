# Smart-Collars-for-Pets
The "Smart Collars for Pets" project involves developing a web application to track pets' locations in real-time using smart collars, displaying their movements on an interactive map with boundary alerts and location history. The system allows users to enter pet details and monitor their safety within a defined area.
